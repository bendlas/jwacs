KNOWN ISSUES:

* Objects may have an unexpected field named $init during construction.
* Function.apply cannot be used to call functions that have been transformed
  (in other words, it should only be used on functions such as library functions
  that have definitely not been transformed).
* The with statement is not supported at all
* The parser does not do semicolon insertion.
