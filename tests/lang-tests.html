<h2>jwacs language tests</h2>
<p>
This html file is a wrapper that runs the portion of the jwacs unit tests that
are actually written in jwacs.  The tests themselves are located in 
<a href='lang-tests.jw'>lang-tests.jw</a>.
That file needs to be compiled into <a href='lang-tests.js'>lang-tests.js</a> 
before changes will be reflected in the tests run by this file.  You can compile
by typing <code>(jw::process #P"lang-tests.jw")</code> from the REPL (although you
may need to give a full path to the jwacs source).

<p>
Everything after the next heading is output from the automated tests.
